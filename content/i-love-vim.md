I actually use neovim.

(neo)vim as a text/code editor is amazing, but it wont be the focus of this
post, what I want to discuss about are vim motions and why I believe everyone 
should learn them.

## Why I love vim(motions)

Vim motions are amazing, I cannot put into words why or how exactly but trust 
me, they are. Once you learn them they unlock a level of "connection" between
your mind and the computer that I have never achieved with anything else. It
seems silly, and defenetly nerdy (because it is), but its very hard to leave
it behind once you achieve it.

At first they might seem very hard, complicated and unnatural but its worth the
hussle.

Many applications use vim motions, so, with the right set of tools, you can 
interact with your computer without moving your hands from the home row of your
keyboard.

## There is no way you could remember that many keybinds

But that's the neat part, you don't!

Apart from `h` `j` `k` `l` most motions are mapped to the first letter of 
the action you want to perform, `w` moves you one [w]ord forward, `b` goes 
[b]ack one word, `u` is for [u]ndo changes (like `Ctrl+Z`), `i` is for [i]nsert 
and many more. 

But the best part comes when mixing them: 

- `d` stands for [d]elete, delete what? Whatever you want!
- `dw` will [d]elete the [w]ord you are in, `dd` will delete the whole line.
- `y` stands for [y]ank (copy)
- `yw` will [y]ank the [w]ord you are in, `yy` will yank the whole line.

And it gets better:

- Guess what `d2w` will do? [d]elete [2] [w]ords.
- And `y6j`? [y]ank [6] [j (down)]
- `p69` will [p]aste what you have selected 69 times.
- you get the point...

All motions can be combined with one another in some way so once you learn the
base motions you can combine them in countless ways to do anything you can think
of without thinking about it, as you think what you want to do, your fingers
move acordingly spelling your thoughts as movements, isn't that amazing?
