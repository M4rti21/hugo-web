I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna use this for, guess I&rsquo;ll figure it out as I go.

Recently I&rsquo;ve been realizing how the internet has become a big monopoly, what I
mean is that the web was intended to be this place where you&rsquo;d navigate across
websites, there&rsquo;d be websites with links to other websites and it was fun to
discover countless new sites about different topics.">

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been realizing how the internet has become a big monopoly, what I
mean is that the web was intended to be this place where you&rsquo;d navigate across
websites, there&rsquo;d be websites with links to other websites and it was fun to
discover countless new sites about different topics.</p>
<p>Nowadays that has been monopolized, there are still some small websites but now
its all controlled by a handfull of companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit&hellip;)
and not many more.</p>
<p>That has some advantages, for example, you don&rsquo;t have to put much efford or
thought into your internet life, you want to see videos? go to YouTube, you
want to scroll through your friends posts? go to Instagram&hellip; Post on one place
and everyone
will be able to see it, you don&rsquo;t have to drive people to your site to see your
stuff, it will get recommended by some sort of algorythm and everyone will get
to know you, that can be good for some businesess to get some easy marketing,
it has given lots of people a career being a content creator and surley there
are more good things about it that I haven&rsquo;t even thought aboyt.</p>
<p>But that has some implications, first is that as I have been noticing for quite
a while now, most of the internet is now shifted to play with the system, most
YouTube videos&rsquo; thumbnails are clickbait so they&rsquo;ll get more views, even if
mindless ones, most Twitter posts are bait so people engage on the comments,
TikTok has a bunch of nothingness on it to the point where someone can spend 6h
scrolling on it and not be able to recall a single thing they saw on that,
because they didn&rsquo;t, your brain stays on a semi-awake stage just letting time
go by without doing anything.</p>
<p>I might write my thoughts more deeply on that once I figure out how I really
feel about all of this, but what I wanted to get to is:</p>
<p>With such monopolies platforms decide who to give a voice and controll the view
people have on the world, that&rsquo;s not what the internet was for (actually it was
created for military purposes but that&rsquo;s besides the point&hellip;), I want to bring
the old internet back, where people are not relying on big platforms to get
each other thoughts, to get their media, to interact with people, and so even
though I&rsquo;m not sure for how long I&rsquo;ll keep this up or if I&rsquo;ll use it at all,
I&rsquo;ve decided to at least give this a try, to see if it is possible to go back
to a more &ldquo;pure&rdquo; way of doing things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use this website to post my thoughts on stuff, I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to
find, read or care about anything that I say in here, but I&rsquo;d rather speak my
mind on a platform I own and I&rsquo;d like to encourage people to do the same.</p>
