		<description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-the-first-post&#34;&gt;This is the first post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;i-dont-know-what-im-gonna-use-this-for-guess-ill-figure-it-out-as-i-go&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna use this for, guess I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out as I go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/stupid.jpg#cover&#34; alt=&#34;stupid&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been realizing how the internet has become a big monopoly, what I mean
is that the web was intended to be this place where you&amp;rsquo;d navigate across websites,
there&amp;rsquo;d be websites with links to other websites and it was fun to discover countless
new sites about different topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays that has been monopolized, there are still some small websites but now its
all controlled by a handfull of companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit&amp;hellip;) and
not many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has some advantages, for example, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to put much efford
or thought into your internet life, you want to see videos? go to YouTube, you want to
scroll through your friends posts? go to Instagram&amp;hellip; Post on one place and everyone
will be able to see it, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to drive people to your site to see your stuff,
it will get recommended by some sort of algorythm and everyone will get to know you,
that can be good for some businesess to get some easy marketing, it has given lots of
people a career being a content creator and surley there are more good things about it
that I haven&amp;rsquo;t even thought aboyt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that has some implications, first is that as I have been noticing for quite a while
now, most of the internet is now shifted to play with the system, most YouTube videos&#39;
thumbnails are clickbait so they&amp;rsquo;ll get more views, even if mindless ones, most Twitter
posts are bait so people engage on the comments, TikTok has a bunch of nothingness on it
to the point where someone can spend 6h scrolling on it and not be able to recall a single
thing they saw on that, because they didn&amp;rsquo;t, your brain stays on a semi-awake stage just
letting time go by without doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might write my thoughts more deeply on that once I figure out how I really feel about
all of this, but what I wanted to get to is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such monopolies platforms decide who to give a voice and controll the view people
have on the world, that&amp;rsquo;s not what the internet was for (actually it was created for
military purposes but that&amp;rsquo;s besides the point&amp;hellip;), I want to bring the old internet
back, where people are not relying on big platforms to get each other thoughts, to get
their media, to interact with people, and so even though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure for how long I&amp;rsquo;ll
keep this up or if I&amp;rsquo;ll use it at all, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to at least give this a try, to see
if it is possible to go back to a more &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll use this website to post my thoughts on stuff, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect anyone to
find, read or care about anything that I say in here, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather speak my mind
on a platform I own and I&amp;rsquo;d like to encourage people to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
